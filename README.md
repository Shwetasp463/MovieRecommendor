# MovieRecommendor

This project is a **Movie Recommender System** developed using **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, focusing on providing movie suggestions based on user preferences and data insights. The system utilizes **Pandas** for efficient data manipulation and exploration, enabling the processing of movie attributes, user ratings, and genres. With the help of **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**, it visualizes key insights such as rating distributions, popularity trends, and genre-based preferences, enhancing the interpretability of the dataset. By employing approaches like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or popularity-based recommendations, the project aims to deliver personalized movie suggestions. This recommender system serves as a practical application of data analysis and visualization skills in a real-world context.
